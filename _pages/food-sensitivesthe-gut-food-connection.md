My stomach used to bloat like a pregnant woman and I found it hard to sleep. I felt like I’d tried everything. Then with a bit of hesitation started to work with Sandra Tenge, as I’d never visited a naturopath in my life. She treated me for a few months and now I am free of all these problems. I am enjoying yummy food, with out any problem. I am so grateful I met her. No more bloating, No more discomfort. No more sleepless nights.”</p><p> </p><p>“I recently worked with Anna Block since being debilitated with gut problems for the past five years and can easily say I haven’t felt this good in years! Anna looked at my issues holistically, helping me set a specific nutrition plan for my hormones and where I was at, and we worked to resolve my stress and hidden mental triggers, both which set me on a more effective recovery path and made me feel liberated and free for the first time in ages! I would highly recommend Anna to anyone dealing with gut issues who feels stuck in their recovery and wants to navigate the hidden obstacles of making a long term change in their health possible. Anna’s knowledge and support is amazing!” – Alanna E.</p><p>Please note: Monday 21st of October is an ONLINE EVENT. Saturday 26th of October will be held at the Brighton Wellness Group, Brighton VIC.
